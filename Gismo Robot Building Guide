Gismo Robot Building Guide

Introduction

This guide will walk you through the process of building Gismo, an interactive robot powered by a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W. Gismo is equipped with a variety of sensors, motors, and interactive components, allowing it to navigate its environment, avoid obstacles, respond to touch and sound, and even express emotions through its OLED display.

Before You Begin

    Gather all the necessary components (see the list below).
    Make sure you have a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W with the latest Raspberry Pi OS installed.
    Set up a virtual environment (recommended) to manage the Python libraries.
    Install the required libraries (see the requirements.txt file).

Components

    Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W
    PCA9685 16-Channel PWM Driver
    SSD1306 128x64 OLED Display
    KY-006 Passive Buzzer
    KY-033 Edge Detection Module (x2)
    KY-032 Infrared Distance Sensor
    KY-020 Tilt Sensor
    KY-034 7-Color LED Module
    TTP223B Capacitive Touch Sensor
    KY-004 Button Module
    KY-016 RGB LED Module
    CHQ1838 Infrared Receiver Module
    Grove Ultrasonic Distance Sensor
    TS-YM-115 Sound Sensor
    Pi Camera Rev 1.3 (optional)
    Jumper wires, breadboard (for prototyping)
    Chassis or frame (for the final build)
    Battery and charger (if using a battery-powered setup)

Wiring

    Connect the components according to the wiring diagram and color scheme provided in the gismo_info.txt file.
    Pay close attention to the connections to the PCA9685 and the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins.
    Double-check all connections for accuracy and secure them properly.

Code

    Download the Gismo code files (e.g., gismo_v1.12.py) from the GitHub repository.
    Review the code and understand its different sections and functions.
    Customize the code if needed (e.g., adjust parameters, add new behaviors).
    Run the code on your Raspberry Pi and test the robot's functionality.

Calibration and Testing

    Calibrate the servos using the servo_calibration.py code.
    Test each component individually using the provided test code files (e.g., buzzer_test.py, edge_sensor_test.py).
    Test the integrated behavior of the robot using the main gismo.py code.
    Fine-tune the parameters and behavior as needed.

Building the Final Robot

    Design and construct the chassis or frame for your robot.
    Mount the components securely to the chassis.
    Route the wires neatly and securely.
    Connect the battery or power source.
    Test the robot's functionality in its final form.

Tips

    Start with a breadboard prototype to test the wiring and code before building the final robot.
    Label your wires and connections clearly.
    Take pictures or create diagrams of your wiring for future reference.
    Be patient and persistent. Building a robot can be challenging, but it's also a rewarding learning experience.

Enjoy the process of building and exploring with your Gismo robot!
